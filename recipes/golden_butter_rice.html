            <h1>Golden Butter Rice Recipes</h1>
        <p><img src="../images/golden_butter_rice.jpg" alt="The recipe image" height="242" width="364"></p>
        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p>This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice.<br>
            It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it really is rice cooked in butter. This is my favorite<br>
            version, with seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger</li>
             <li>1 1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
             <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
             <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
             <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
             <li>2 cups basmati rice or other long grain white rice</li>
             <li>3 cups water</li>
             <li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
             <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat.<br>
          As soon as butter starts to bubble, add in ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar,<br>
          and salt. Cook, whisking, for 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Add rice, and stir until every grain is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring<br>
            to a boil over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake and swirl the pan to<br>
            settle rice into an even layer, then reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
           <li>Cover tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off heat, and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes.<br>
            DO NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet.</li>
            <li>Now, remove the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains. Season to taste, and<br>
                serve immediately, garnished with walnuts and green onions.</li>
        </ol>
